Small edit if you want to make [All this are optional]:
- You can "bold" the text like "Email:", "Tel:",  etc anything with a heading to give the user much more clearer information [I mean this is optional].
- In Accomodation.html, for like "nearest mrt", you could orginised it with a unorder list and the icon could be the colour of the MRT line or the small little icons of the MRT [Ask Kai if you are not sure i already brief him on this]
- Your footer background can be black colour [It just to not hurt the user eyes and usually most website footer background are black or dark in colour]
- You want to change the main html, javascript or css to either index.html, style.css, script.js. This is to tell the person reading the your code which is the main files [Note: when your rename the files, the code inside which have anchor hyperlinks must also be changed]


What I have changed:

* Overall changes (Global)
- I re-edit the format of all your files, indentation and corrected those typo errors etc. [Example: "alr" to "alt", "<a/>" to "</a>"]
- Added Navagation logo to be clickable and when click, it navigate to Homepage.html. ['<a href="Homepage.html"><img src="images/UON_logo.png" alt="logo"></a>']
- Added footer email and tel achor tag ['<p>Email: <a href=mailto:uonenquiry@newcastle.edu.au>uonenquiry@newcastle.edu.au</a></p>'] ['<p>Phone: <a href="tel:+6562213306">+65 6221 3306</a></p>', '<p>FAX: <a href="tel:+6562213307">+65 6221 3307</a></p>']
- Remove all discussion_form.html on header because you guys scratch it out.
- Added meta tag for media method in css file ['<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">']
- Updated db_connection.php
- Added dashboard_users.php, add_user.php, edit_user.php, delete_user.php [If the database does not work, please change the database name accordingly, under "$dbname"]
- Added dashboard_posts.php, add_post.php, edit_post.php, delete_post.php [If the database does not work, please change the database name accordingly, under "$dbname"] 

- !!!!!!!! Note that it is important to handle database operations more securely and consider using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. !!!!!!!!
- If you want to add method to prevent a SQL injection attack, add it in the php tag of add_user.php, edit_user.php, add_post.php, edit_post.php.

- When adding a ' to the html, please use "&apos;" instead due to php loading. If not the php will not work.


Page.css
- Under Page.css, line 135, you have stated "not done". Please in the future when you want to state "not done", please add in more details on what is not done so that you will not forget.

- Added missing semicolon (";") at the end of each CSS rule.
- Fixed the "margin" property value in the "nav ul" rule to "margin: 0".
- Fixed the "display" property value in the "nav ul" rule to "display: flex".
- Fixed the "margin" property value in the ".logo" rule to "margin-right: auto".
- Fixed the "font" property value in the ".container .button" rule to "font: bold".
- Added missing closing brace ("}") at the end of the CSS code.

- Added @media for Navagation dropdown on "Services" so that they align when hover over but only up to laptops anything above "1024px" will be bugged. Try to fix it if you can using @media. [This one gave me a headache]


Accomodation.html
- I notice for your housing options, the select button does nothing [Just a heads up].
- Changes all the email and telephone to a hyperlink format.


AcomResources.html
- Note: your "Start A Discussion" button does nothing.


add_post.html
- This files has not been created: "edit-post.html", "add-post.html", "delete-posts.html".
- Changed 'form action=' from "/add_post" to "/addpost.php".


admin_login.html
- Fixed user login successfully and unsuccessful
- Maked changes to "function login" so when click submit, it won't refresh until the javascript has run the validation.


dashboard.html
- Moved the "<th>" elements inside "<tr>" in the "<thead>" section.
- Corrected the formatting of the table header.
- Removed an extra line break after the "<thead>" section.
- Fixed the indentation of the "<td>" elements inside the table body.


ExploreCS.html
- Take note that the select button does nothing. 


Food.html
- The explore button does nothing.


logout.php
- Added session cookie to be deleted when logout.


main.js
- I encapsulated the post creation logic into a function to make the code more modular and easier to read.
- Added a check to see if the "Post" button element exists before adding the click event listener to avoid errors if the button is missing on the page.
- Used postContainer.appendChild(postElement) instead of postContainer.innerHTML += postElement.outerHTML to directly append the created post element to the post container, which is more efficient and safer.


script.js
- Added eventListener
- Fixed duplicate function "EditPost" and rename on of them as "EditPostById"
- undefined publishPost function in Line 112


style.css
- Removed duplicate ".content" styling.
- Set "width: 100%" for the "table" to ensure it spans the full width.
- Removed the unnecessary "hover" styles for ".edit", ".delete", and ".publish", and added a "cursor: pointer" style to indicate they are clickable.
- Improved the styling of the ".text-inpu"t class to give a clearer input field appearance.
- Removed some unnecessary styling that might conflict with other elements or cause unintended layout issues.
